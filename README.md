# Front-End Interview Test - McMakler

Simple React web app with Login and List view page

### Prerequisites

`node` and `npm` should be installed on your local machine

### Running App

1. Download repository
2. From the root directory run following commands from terminal

```
npm install
npm run serve
```

3. NOTE: The API user for this test does not support cross-origin request. So I had to use a chrome browser [plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi) to make the API work for me from `localhost`. 
  Please install it if required.

4. Open `localhost:8080/public/index.html`
